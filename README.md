To install, just run `gis_day_install.py` or download the project and extract into `C:\Student\GISDay_2022`

This project was compiled in ArcGIS Pro 2.9.1 so earlier version may give you a warning of incompatibility.  Should work, however. 


## Tips on how to learn Python for GIS Professionals

- [https://www.learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/) is a good free option. Not quite as polished as Code Academey, but free and it will hone in on the basic building blocks to get confortoable with the sytax.
- [https://www.codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com) has a slick web interface and very effective, but the good stuff will cost you around $17 a month for the Pro Lite version.  I would suggest this if you're serious about learning good Python syntax basics, as you might have an easier time learning. You can also try the free trial for Pro if you're unsure. 
- Lots of lots of googling. I use keywords all the time like `arcpy delete` or `arcpy list featureclasses` or `arcpy environment variables`.
- It's kind of impossible to remember all the sytax for the arcpy functions.  I highly recommend "cheating" and using the graphical tool once in ArcGIS Pro and copy the python command from the "Run" command drop down button.  Study the output, learn from it, modify it, and run it on its own.
